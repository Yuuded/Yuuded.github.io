Not me:
- CSS
- Low priority: Rearrange add, modify & report when expanded.

- Passar todos os onAlert() e os confirm para models
- IMPORTANT: Create tests accounts and put there the test servers. Last thing to do and in the real deployment. Must be done at most tomorrow though, because some servers
need 48h of inactivity...

Done:
- admins working on ADD;
- startAt and finishAt working on ADD;
- error processing on ADD;
- Auto-update server list.
- Turning off the server puts nUsers to 0;
- Instant serverList refrest when new server is added;
- Turning on/off server actualizes onlineSince;
- Turning on/off server actualizes lastActiveUser;
- O close (ou wtv) do report.php volta para o serverListHelper.html (lado direito) ou serverList.html (lado esquerdo).
- Done ask for confirmation when a Register/Modify is open and one opens modify server/create server with the Server list.
- Warning messages for turning on/off server and deleting server.
- Handling server deletion while in report.php.
- Data support in modify
- Verifications in client-side (modify)
- Support admins
- Somewhat important: modify putting server offline when changing some stuff.
- Changes in modify server instantaneously (or close to) update server list (force refresh)
- Warning message on modify (and ask confirmation) in case that a server restart is needed.
- Error processing
- VERY IMPORTANT: handling server was deleted while in modify.
- Somewhat important: add the ? to modify
- add extra option for server state: yellow exclamation mark when no one has used the server for more than 48h.
- Some scripts for updating nº of clients (client-side) (includes actualizing lastActiveUser)
- Support nUsers automatic update on modify.
- users update must also update the Time since last user;
- In report/modify, change the nUsers color depending on how full the server is.
- Supported non-complete remove. Ignored complete remove.
- Low priority: in report and modify, put a message saying that it's downloading the server information (and then take it out)
- Put delete in modifyServer to work.
- Put logged in page in a different page, to solve refresh problems
- High priority: fix some stuff in login/register (login still gets filled by register and probably vice-versa, fail in register goes back to login)
- Remove account settings.

What's 100% complete (excluding models):
- addServer
- report

var ownerEmail = localStorage.getItem("email");

var remainingAdminsIDs = {};

Stuff that forces a server restart (if it's online): capacity, host, port, online/offline (duh)
